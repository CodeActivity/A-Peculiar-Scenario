Welcome to "A Peculiar Scenario" - it's a rather strange game based in the Python Language.
It is developed by JakesCode, better known as Stringcraftgaming on the Indie Games Website, Gamejolt.
Jake has worked with many languages in the past, but Python is his latest "mission", so to speak.

"A Pecular Scenario" is a Text-Based Adventure Game, where commands are inputted into a "main line"
to complete tasks, move, inspect locations, take items - the list goes on.

The game will be updated whenever possible.
Please leave issues on the dedicated GitHub section.

Thanks for playing!
